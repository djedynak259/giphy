Giphy Generator

React web app using the GIPHY API to load gifs.

GIPHY API Docs: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

This web app features the ability to display gifs and their information (accompanied by a sweet swooshing hover effect) based on user search input.  

Gifs may be sorted based on their upload date - Newest or Oldest first.

Once gifs are loaded, you may scroll down to show additional gifs.
