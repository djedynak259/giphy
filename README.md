Giphy Generator

React web app using the GIPHY API to load gifs.

GIPHY API Docs: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

This web app features the ability to display gifs and their information (accompanied by a sweet swooshing hover effect) based on search input.  Gifs may also be sorted based on their upload date - Newest or Oldest.

Once gifs are loaded, you may scroll down to show additional gifs related to the search.
